# Request 25-9259

Subject: CPRA Request -- Balboa Park Paid Parking -- Original Zoo Agreement(s)

To the Records Coordinator:

Pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code §§ 7920.000 et
seq.) and the right of access guaranteed by Article I, Section 3(b) of
the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59, the San Diego
Transparency Project requests the following public records.

### **Records Requested**

*Please provide the fully executed versions of the following:*

1.  ****The Lease Agreement between the City of San Diego and the
    Zoological Society of San Diego, signed July 23, 1979 and filed with
    the San Diego City Clerk on August 31, 1979 as Document No. 767195
    ("Lease").****
2.  **The executed First Amendment to the Lease**, as approved by City
    Council in **Resolution R-316408**, modifying Section 7 relating to
    parking-fee authority and related terms.
3.  ****Any and all other executed amendments, supplements, extensions,
    restatements, addenda, or modifications to the Lease that are
    currently in effect.****

This request seeks **only final, fully executed agreements** retained in
the ordinary course of business.\
Drafts, negotiations, attorney-client communications, and deliberative
materials are **not** requested.

Please produce responsive records on a rolling basis as they become
available, rather than waiting until the request is fully complete.

**Processing & Timelines**

-   Please provide a determination within 10 calendar days as required
    by law.
-   If an extension is necessary, please identify the statutory basis
    under Gov. Code § 7922.535(b) and provide an estimated completion
    date.
-   Gov. Code § 6253(d) prohibits using the 10-day period or any
    provision of law to delay access for purposes of inspection.
-   Article I, Section 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution requires
    all provisions to be construed broadly in favor of access and
    limitations on access to be interpreted narrowly.
-   If any responsive records can be produced before the entire request
    is complete, please release those portions on a rolling basis as
    they become available.

**Assistance to Clarify/Narrow**

-   Agencies have an affirmative duty to assist requesters in making
    focused and effective requests pursuant to Gov. Code § 6253.1.
-   If clarification would expedite processing, please contact us
    pursuant to § 7922.600 so we may assist in refining scope.

**Withholdings & Redactions**

-   For any withheld or redacted records, please provide:

    -   The specific statutory exemption relied upon for each.
    -   A description sufficient to identify the nature of the record
        (e.g., email chain, memo, report) and approximate volume (page
        count or number of records).
    -   An explanation of how the exemption applies, as required by Gov.
        Code § 7922.535(a).

-   If you contend any portion of a record is exempt, Gov. Code §
    6253(a) requires segregation and release of all reasonably
    segregable portions.

**Search Scope**

-   To facilitate timely resolution, please confirm which custodians and
    systems will be searched. Likely custodians include:
-   Real Estate Assets Department (READ)
-   City Attorney's Office (for contract retention)
-   Office of the Mayor
-   Docket Services / Legislative Affairs
-   Any department responsible for administering Zoo lease terms

Thank you for your assistance and timely response.
