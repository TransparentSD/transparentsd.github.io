# Request 25-8848

**Subject:** CPRA Request -- Beach Bug Shuttle: Vendor

**To the Records Coordinator:**

Pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code §§ 7920.000 et
seq.) and Article I, § 3(b) of the California Constitution, the San
Diego Transparency Project requests the following public records
relating to the City's evaluation and termination of the Pacific Beach
"Beach Bug" community shuttle program.

This request follows the closure of CPRA No. 25-8456 ("no responsive
records") and restates the information sought with greater specificity,
as the City did not provide the assistance required under Gov. Code §
7922.600 (formerly § 6253.1).

### **Date Range:** June 1 2022 -- present

### **Records Requested**

##### **Contracts and Amendments**

-   Contracts, purchase orders, task orders, amendments, or extensions
    with any vendor, contractor, or subcontractor that provided
    **operation or support services** for the Pacific Beach "Beach Bug"
    shuttle program.
-   This includes any agreements or modifications involving **Ride
    Circuit** or any other vendor associated with operating or winding
    down the service.

##### **Vendor Correspondence**

-   Emails or correspondence between City staff (including CPD
    administrators or project managers) and any vendor involved in Beach
    Bug operations regarding **service changes, schedule adjustments,
    extensions, or termination of service**.
-   Any notices or communications transmitting **termination
    instructions or acknowledgments** to or from the vendor.

##### **Contract Close-Out and Termination Documentation**

-   Notices of **contract completion, cancellation, or non-renewal**,
    and any related **transition or end-of-service plans**.
-   Correspondence or forms concerning **equipment removal, data
    transfer, return of materials, or settlement of outstanding
    obligations**.
-   Internal or vendor-submitted reports summarizing **final results,
    close-out actions, or transition to other programs**.

### **Preferred Format**

Please provide responsive records in their native digital format where
available, consistent with Gov. Code § 6253.9.

### **Processing & Timelines**

Please provide a determination within 10 calendar days as required by §
7922.535.\
If an extension is necessary, identify the statutory basis and provide
an estimated completion date.\
Please release responsive material on a **rolling basis** as it becomes
available.

### **Assistance to Clarify / Duty to Assist**

Under Gov. Code § 7922.600, agencies must assist requesters in
identifying records and describing the information sought.\
If clarification would expedite processing, please contact us **before
closing the request** so we may refine scope collaboratively.

### **Withholdings & Redactions**

For any withheld or redacted records, please provide:

-   The specific statutory exemption relied upon;
-   A description sufficient to identify each record's nature and
    approximate volume; and
-   An explanation of how the exemption applies, as required by §
    7922.535(a).\
    Please release all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions.

### **Search Scope**

Please identify all offices, staff, and systems reasonably likely to
hold responsive material.\
This includes, but is **not limited to**, departments or contractors
involved in parking management, transportation, sustainability &
mobility, procurement, budget oversight, or administration of the
Pacific Beach Community Parking District.\
If any such custodians or systems are *excluded* from the search, please
identify them and explain why.\
Nothing in this paragraph should be construed to limit the City's
obligation to conduct a thorough search for responsive records under
Gov. Code § 7922.600.

### **Purpose and Public Interest**

This request seeks to document the City's contractual and administrative
actions surrounding the conclusion of the Pacific Beach "Beach Bug"
shuttle program, including vendor communications, amendments, and
termination records. It is intended to identify who reviewed or
authorized the termination, what analyses or recommendations informed
that decision, and how the conclusion was communicated or implemented
within the City.

Although this request focuses on the City's decision-making and
oversight phase, it forms part of a broader public effort to understand
the full life cycle of the Beach Bug program --- from funding through
termination --- to ensure transparency in the use of Community Parking
District revenues and promised local-mobility projects. Access to these
records is plainly in the public interest and consistent with Article I,
§ 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution, which requires open access to
local-government records and narrowly construes any claimed limitation.
