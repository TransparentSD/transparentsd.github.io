# Beach Bug Project

Last updated: 2025-11-22 (DRAFT)

---

## Overview

The City used public resources from parking meters in coastal communities to fund the "Beach Bug" shuttle program. Questions have been raised about financial transparency, contract oversight, and whether these funds were used in accordance with legal restrictions and public benefit objectives.

This matters because parking meter revenue is required to be used for neighborhood improvements and transportation access — not general spending or unrelated programs.
