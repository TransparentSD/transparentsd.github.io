# Request 25-9263

**Subject:** CPRA Request -- Beach Bug Shuttle: Mobility Board Briefings
& Notifications

**To the Records Coordinator:**

Pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code §§ 7920.000 et
seq.) and Article I, § 3(b) of the California Constitution, the San
Diego Transparency Project requests the following public records
relating to the City's evaluation and termination of the Pacific Beach
"Beach Bug" community shuttle program.

This is a new and separate request focused solely on the specific record
categories listed below. This request follows the release of PRA 25-8845
emails referencing City staff notifying the Mobility Board and preparing
related materials.

### **Date Range:** June 1 2022 -- present

### **Records Requested**

**1. Mobility Board Notification Materials**

-   Emails, attachments, or briefing materials transmitted to Mobility
    Board members or staff notifying them of the pilot's end.
-   Any talking points, summaries, or background materials prepared for
    or used in communicating with the Mobility Board.

**2. Mobility Board Meeting Documentation**

-   Agendas, meeting packets, staff reports, or internal summaries
    referencing Beach Bug continuation, modification, or termination.
-   Notes or correspondence indicating whether updates were planned but
    not presented.

**3. Correspondence with Mobility Board Liaison Staff**

-   Communications between Sustainability & Mobility, Communications,
    the Mayor's Office, or Council staff and Mobility Board liaison
    personnel regarding awareness, notification timing, or presentation
    of the program's conclusion.

### **Preferred Format**

Please provide responsive records in their native digital format where
available, consistent with Gov. Code § 6253.9.

### **Processing & Timelines**

Please provide a determination within 10 calendar days as required by §
7922.535.\
If an extension is necessary, identify the statutory basis and provide
an estimated completion date.\
Please release responsive material on a **rolling basis** as it becomes
available.

### **Assistance to Clarify / Duty to Assist**

Under Gov. Code § 7922.600, agencies must assist requesters in
identifying records and describing the information sought.\
If clarification would expedite processing, please contact us **before
closing the request** so we may refine scope collaboratively.

### **Withholdings & Redactions**

For any withheld or redacted records, please provide:

-   The specific statutory exemption relied upon;
-   A description sufficient to identify each record's nature and
    approximate volume; and
-   An explanation of how the exemption applies, as required by §
    7922.535(a).\
    Please release all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions.

### **Search Scope**

Please identify all offices, staff, and systems reasonably likely to
hold responsive material.\
This includes, but is **not limited to**, departments or contractors
involved in parking management, transportation, sustainability &
mobility, procurement, budget oversight, or administration of the
Pacific Beach Community Parking District.\
If any such custodians or systems are *excluded* from the search, please
identify them and explain why.\
Nothing in this paragraph should be construed to limit the City's
obligation to conduct a thorough search for responsive records under
Gov. Code § 7922.600.

### **Purpose and Public Interest**

This request seeks to document the City's evaluation, internal
discussion, and approval process surrounding the conclusion of the
Pacific Beach "Beach Bug" shuttle program. It is intended to identify
who reviewed or authorized the termination, what analyses or
recommendations informed that decision, and how the conclusion was
communicated or implemented within the City.

Although this request focuses on the City's decision-making and
oversight phase, it forms part of a broader public effort to understand
the full life cycle of the Beach Bug program --- from funding through
termination --- to ensure transparency in the use of Community Parking
District revenues and promised local-mobility projects. Access to these
records is plainly in the public interest and consistent with Article I,
§ 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution, which requires open access to
local-government records and narrowly construes any claimed limitation.
