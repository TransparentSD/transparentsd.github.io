# Request 25-8847

**Subject:** CPRA Request -- Beach Bug Shuttle: City Evaluation and
Termination

**To the Records Coordinator:**

Pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code §§ 7920.000 et
seq.) and Article I, § 3(b) of the California Constitution, the San
Diego Transparency Project requests the following public records
relating to the City's evaluation and termination of the Pacific Beach
"Beach Bug" community shuttle program.

This request follows the closure of CPRA No. 25-8456 ("no responsive
records") and restates the information sought with greater specificity,
as the City did not provide the assistance required under Gov. Code §
7922.600 (formerly § 6253.1).

### **Date Range:** June 1 2022 -- present

### **Records Requested**

##### **Evaluation and Termination Discussions**

-   Records, memoranda, emails, reports, or correspondence reflecting
    any **evaluation, analysis, discussion, or consideration** of
    continuing, modifying, suspending, or ending the Beach Bug shuttle
    program.
-   This includes any documentation of **findings, performance
    observations, recommendations, or conclusions** that informed or
    followed the decision to end or not renew the program.

##### **Authorizations and Direction**

-   Records identifying any **department, division, or official** who
    reviewed, approved, acknowledged, or was notified of the conclusion
    of the Beach Bug program.
-   Communications among City staff, the Mayor's Office, **the
    Councilmember for District 1**, or Community Parking District
    representatives regarding the decision, rationale, or timing of
    ending the program.
-   Any correspondence showing **awareness, concurrence, or approval**
    by elected officials or senior management related to the termination
    or winding-down of Beach Bug operations.

##### **Meetings and Public Process**

-   Agendas, minutes, recordings, staff reports, or presentations from
    any City-chartered meeting, departmental briefing, or CPD Advisory
    Board session where the Beach Bug's evaluation, continuation, or
    termination was discussed or acted upon.
-   Notes or summaries documenting recommendations or consensus on
    ending the program, including follow-up communications.

##### **Public and Media Communication**

-   Draft or final **press releases, public statements, talking points,
    website content, or social-media posts** prepared or reviewed by
    City staff relating to the end of the Beach Bug program.
-   Correspondence with residents, media, or community organizations
    explaining the program's conclusion, evaluation results, or next
    steps.

### **Preferred Format**

Please provide responsive records in their native digital format where
available, consistent with Gov. Code § 6253.9.

### **Processing & Timelines**

Please provide a determination within 10 calendar days as required by §
7922.535.\
If an extension is necessary, identify the statutory basis and provide
an estimated completion date.\
Please release responsive material on a **rolling basis** as it becomes
available.

### **Assistance to Clarify / Duty to Assist**

Under Gov. Code § 7922.600, agencies must assist requesters in
identifying records and describing the information sought.\
If clarification would expedite processing, please contact us **before
closing the request** so we may refine scope collaboratively.

### **Withholdings & Redactions**

For any withheld or redacted records, please provide:

-   The specific statutory exemption relied upon;
-   A description sufficient to identify each record's nature and
    approximate volume; and
-   An explanation of how the exemption applies, as required by §
    7922.535(a).\
    Please release all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions.

### **Search Scope**

Please identify all offices, staff, and systems reasonably likely to
hold responsive material.\
This includes, but is **not limited to**, departments or contractors
involved in parking management, transportation, sustainability &
mobility, procurement, budget oversight, or administration of the
Pacific Beach Community Parking District.\
If any such custodians or systems are *excluded* from the search, please
identify them and explain why.\
Nothing in this paragraph should be construed to limit the City's
obligation to conduct a thorough search for responsive records under
Gov. Code § 7922.600.

### **Purpose and Public Interest**

This request seeks to document the City's evaluation, internal
discussion, and approval process leading to or acknowledging the
conclusion of the Pacific Beach "Beach Bug" shuttle program. It is
intended to identify who reviewed or authorized the termination, what
analyses or recommendations informed that decision, and how the
conclusion was communicated or implemented within the City.

Although this request focuses on the City's decision-making and
oversight phase, it forms part of a broader public effort to understand
the full life cycle of the Beach Bug program --- from funding through
termination --- to ensure transparency in the use of Community Parking
District revenues and promised local-mobility projects. Access to these
records is plainly in the public interest and consistent with Article I,
§ 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution, which requires open access to
local-government records and narrowly construes any claimed limitation.
