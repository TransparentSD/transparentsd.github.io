# Request 25-9258

Subject: CPRA Request -- Balboa Park Paid Parking -- New Zoo Agreement(s)

To the Records Coordinator:

Pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code §§ 7920.000 et
seq.) and the right of access guaranteed by Article I, Section 3(b) of
the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59, the San Diego
Transparency Project requests the following public records.

This request follows the City's non-response to a clarification posted
in Request **25-6794**, which asked whether a final, executed agreement
exists between the City and the San Diego Zoo / San Diego Zoo Wildlife
Alliance (SDZWA) regarding Balboa Park parking. Multiple public
sources---including City blog postings and Council agenda materials
released in early September 2025---indicate that a lease amendment or
related agreement may have been considered or approved.

**Records Requested**

Please provide:

-   **The final, executed agreement **and/****or** lease amendment (if
    any)** between the City of San Diego and SDZWA concerning Balboa
    Park parking, related parking fees, revenue terms, or operational
    accommodations. This request refers specifically to any **executed
    agreement, lease amendment, or modification** considered or
    referenced in connection with the Council docket items and City blog
    postings published on **September 5--8, 2025**, including any
    agreement described as authorizing, permitting, or modifying
    **parking operations, parking fee authority, or revenue terms** for
    the San Diego Zoo / SDZWA.

This request seeks **only** the fully executed agreement(s).\
Drafts, negotiations, attorney-client communications, or deliberative
materials are **not** requested.

If no final executed agreement exists, please confirm this.

*Please produce responsive records on a rolling basis as they become
available, rather than waiting until the request is fully complete.*

**Processing & Timelines**

-   Please provide a determination within 10 calendar days as required
    by law.
-   If an extension is necessary, please identify the statutory basis
    under Gov. Code § 7922.535(b) and provide an estimated completion
    date.
-   Gov. Code § 6253(d) prohibits using the 10-day period or any
    provision of law to delay access for purposes of inspection.
-   Article I, Section 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution requires
    all provisions to be construed broadly in favor of access and
    limitations on access to be interpreted narrowly.
-   If any responsive records can be produced before the entire request
    is complete, please release those portions on a rolling basis as
    they become available.

**Assistance to Clarify/Narrow**

-   Agencies have an affirmative duty to assist requesters in making
    focused and effective requests pursuant to Gov. Code § 6253.1.
-   If clarification would expedite processing, please contact us
    pursuant to § 7922.600 so we may assist in refining scope.

**Withholdings & Redactions**

-   For any withheld or redacted records, please provide:

    -   The specific statutory exemption relied upon for each.
    -   A description sufficient to identify the nature of the record
        (e.g., email chain, memo, report) and approximate volume (page
        count or number of records).
    -   An explanation of how the exemption applies, as required by Gov.
        Code § 7922.535(a).

-   If you contend any portion of a record is exempt, Gov. Code §
    6253(a) requires segregation and release of all reasonably
    segregable portions.

**Search Scope**

-   To facilitate timely resolution, please confirm which custodians and
    systems will be searched. Likely custodians include:
-   Real Estate Assets Department (READ)
-   City Attorney's Office (for contract retention)
-   Office of the Mayor
-   Docket Services / Legislative Affairs
-   Any department responsible for administering Zoo lease terms

Thank you for your assistance and timely response.
