# San Diego Transparency Project

Promoting openness and accountability in local government by reviewing, organizing, and publishing insights from public records obtained under the California Public Records Act (CPRA).

This project aims to make public information easier for residents to understand and use—highlighting how decisions are made, how public funds are spent, and whether actions align with stated policies and community needs.

By clearly documenting what we learn and what remains unanswered, we hope to support more informed public engagement and respectful oversight of public agencies.
