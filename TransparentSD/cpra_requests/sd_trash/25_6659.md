# Request 25-6659

Subject: CPRA Request -- Records on Residential Collection Cost Modeling
and Rate Adjustments

To the Records Coordinator:

Under the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code §§ 7920.000 et seq.),
the San Diego Transparency Project seeks records documenting the
development, review, and revision of the City's residential waste
collection rates and related operational planning.

**Specifically, we request**:

-   All financial and analytical records that informed or updated the
    cost-of-service model presented in April 2025, including any
    iterations or revisions after the initial February 2025 proposal.
    This should encompass spreadsheets, data sets, vendor contracts,
    invoices, and related correspondence explaining changes made to
    reduce projected rates.
-   Benchmarking and comparative analyses referencing other
    municipalities, as well as internal or consultant memoranda
    evaluating rate alignment or service standards across jurisdictions.
-   Records describing planned service enhancements---such as
    RFID-enabled bins, expanded recycling, and bulky-item pickup---and
    the assumptions or cost factors associated with those features.
-   Community engagement outputs, including presentation materials,
    outreach summaries, and compiled resident feedback used during the
    review and decision-making process.
-   The finalized cost-of-service and operational analysis referenced in
    the City's April 9, 2025 announcement and related public
    communications.

**Processing & Timelines **

-   Please confirm this request within 10 calendar days as required by
    law.
-   If an extension is necessary, specify the statutory authority and
    provide an anticipated completion date.

**Assistance to Clarify/Narrow**

-   If any part of this request requires clarification, please notify us
    pursuant to Gov. Code § 7922.600 so we can assist in refining scope.

Withholdings & Redactions

-   For any withheld or redacted material, identify the exemption
    claimed, describe the record type (e.g., report, spreadsheet,
    email), approximate volume, and explain how the exemption applies,
    as required by Gov. Code § 7922.535(a).
-   Release all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions.

**Search Scope **

-   To ensure completeness, please indicate the custodians and systems
    that will be searched, or confirm if certain repositories are
    excluded and why.

Thank you for your cooperation.
