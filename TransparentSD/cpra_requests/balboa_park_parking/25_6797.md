# Request 25-6797

Subject: CPRA Request -- Balboa Park Paid Parking -- Public Engagement
and Outreach

To the Records Coordinator:

Pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code §§ 7920.000 et
seq.) and the right of access guaranteed by Article I, Section 3(b) of
the California Constitution, as amended by Proposition 59, the San Diego
Transparency Project requests the following public records:

**Date Range**

Nov 1, 2024 → present

If no records exist within this date range, please confirm that in your
response.

**Records Requested**

Please provide all records reflecting ****public engagement, outreach,
or feedback**** regarding Balboa Park paid parking. This request
includes:

-   Public comment summaries, surveys, or reports prepared for staff,
    Council, or committees.
-   Notices, flyers, or outreach materials distributed to the public,
    stakeholders, or community groups.
-   Meeting notes, minutes, or emails documenting feedback received at
    the Balboa Park Committee, community forums, or other public
    meetings concerning Balboa Park paid parking or the parking meter
    zone.
-   Records of outreach or engagement conducted by third-party
    consultants, contractors, or public relations firms on behalf of the
    City.

*Please produce responsive records on a rolling basis as they become
available, rather than waiting until the request is fully complete.*

**Processing & Timelines**

-   Please provide a determination within 10 calendar days as required
    by law.
-   If an extension is necessary, please identify the statutory basis
    under Gov. Code § 7922.535(b) and provide an estimated completion
    date.
-   Gov. Code § 6253(d) prohibits using the 10-day period or any
    provision of law to delay access for purposes of inspection.
-   Article I, Section 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution requires
    all provisions to be construed broadly in favor of access and
    limitations on access to be interpreted narrowly.
-   If any responsive records can be produced before the entire request
    is complete, please release those portions on a rolling basis as
    they become available.

**Assistance to Clarify/Narrow**

-   Agencies have an affirmative duty to assist requesters in making
    focused and effective requests pursuant to Gov. Code § 6253.1.
-   If clarification would expedite processing, please contact us
    pursuant to § 7922.600 so we may assist in refining scope.

**Withholdings & Redactions**

-   For any withheld or redacted records, please provide:

    -   The specific statutory exemption relied upon for each.
    -   A description sufficient to identify the nature of the record
        (e.g., email chain, memo, report) and approximate volume (page
        count or number of records).
    -   An explanation of how the exemption applies, as required by Gov.
        Code § 7922.535(a).

-   If you contend any portion of a record is exempt, Gov. Code §
    6253(a) requires segregation and release of all reasonably
    segregable portions.

**Search Scope**

-   To facilitate timely resolution, please confirm which custodians and
    systems will be searched and the date range applied.

Thank you for your assistance and timely response.
