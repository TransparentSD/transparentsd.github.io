# Request 25-8845

**Subject:** CPRA Request -- Beach Bug Shuttle: **Council District 1**

**To the Records Coordinator:**

Pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code §§ 7920.000 et
seq.) and Article I, § 3(b) of the California Constitution, the San
Diego Transparency Project requests the following public records
relating to the City's evaluation and termination of the Pacific Beach
"Beach Bug" community shuttle program.

This request follows CPRA No. 25-8458, which was erroneously routed to
Council District 2. The intent of this renewed request is to direct it
to **Council District 1 (Councilmember Joe LaCava)**, as the City did
not provide the assistance required under Gov. Code § 7922.600 (formerly
§ 6253.1) to help identify the correct district office.

### **Date Range:** June 1 2022 -- present

### **Records Requested**

##### **Council District 1 and City Communications**

-   Emails, memoranda, or correspondence between **Council District 1
    (Councilmember Joe LaCava and staff)** and City staff, the Mayor's
    Office, or Pacific Beach Community Parking District (CPD)
    representatives concerning the **Beach Bug shuttle program**,
    including:

    -   evaluation, modification, or termination of service;
    -   constituent comments, inquiries, or complaints; and
    -   messaging or coordination regarding the program's conclusion or
        public explanation.

##### **Meetings and Presentations**

-   Agendas, minutes, meeting packets, staff reports, or presentations
    **prepared by, provided to, or discussed with Council District 1
    offices** concerning the evaluation, continuation, or termination of
    the Beach Bug shuttle program.
-   Any post-meeting notes or follow-up communications summarizing
    **recommendations, votes, or decisions** related to ending the
    program.

### **Preferred Format**

Please provide responsive records in their native digital format where
available, consistent with Gov. Code § 6253.9.

### **Processing & Timelines**

Please provide a determination within 10 calendar days as required by §
7922.535.\
If an extension is necessary, identify the statutory basis and provide
an estimated completion date.\
Please release responsive material on a **rolling basis** as it becomes
available.

### **Assistance to Clarify / Duty to Assist**

Under Gov. Code § 7922.600, agencies must assist requesters in
identifying records and describing the information sought.\
If clarification would expedite processing, please contact us **before
closing the request** so we may refine scope collaboratively.

### **Withholdings & Redactions**

For any withheld or redacted records, please provide:

-   The specific statutory exemption relied upon;
-   A description sufficient to identify each record's nature and
    approximate volume; and
-   An explanation of how the exemption applies, as required by §
    7922.535(a).\
    Please release all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions.

### **Search Scope**

Please identify all offices, staff, and systems reasonably likely to
hold responsive material.\
This includes, but is **not limited to**, departments or contractors
involved in parking management, transportation, sustainability &
mobility, procurement, budget oversight, or administration of the
Pacific Beach Community Parking District.\
If any such custodians or systems are *excluded* from the search, please
identify them and explain why.\
Nothing in this paragraph should be construed to limit the City's
obligation to conduct a thorough search for responsive records under
Gov. Code § 7922.600.

### **Purpose and Public Interest**

This request seeks to document the City's evaluation, internal
discussion, and approval process surrounding the conclusion of the
Pacific Beach "Beach Bug" shuttle program. It is intended to identify
who reviewed or authorized the termination, what analyses or
recommendations informed that decision, and how the conclusion was
communicated or implemented within the City.

Although this request focuses on the City's decision-making and
oversight phase, it forms part of a broader public effort to understand
the full life cycle of the Beach Bug program --- from funding through
termination --- to ensure transparency in the use of Community Parking
District revenues and promised local-mobility projects. Access to these
records is plainly in the public interest and consistent with Article I,
§ 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution, which requires open access to
local-government records and narrowly construes any claimed limitation.
