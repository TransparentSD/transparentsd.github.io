# Request 25-9262

**Subject:** CPRA Request -- Beach Bug Shuttle: Internal Evaluation &
Decision Communications

**To the Records Coordinator:**

Pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code §§ 7920.000 et
seq.) and Article I, § 3(b) of the California Constitution, the San
Diego Transparency Project requests the following public records
relating to the City's evaluation and termination of the Pacific Beach
"Beach Bug" community shuttle program.

This is a new and separate request focused solely on the specific record
categories listed below. This request is informed by recently released
emails (PRA 25-8845) showing involvement by the Mayor's Office,
Sustainability & Mobility staff, and the Communications Department that
was not identified in prior CPRA determinations.

### **Date Range:** June 1 2022 -- present

### **Records Requested**

### **1. Internal Evaluation & Decision Discussions**

-   Emails, memoranda, notes, or correspondence among staff in the
    Mayor's Office, Sustainability & Mobility Department, Communications
    Department, Transportation Department, or Council offices related
    to:

    -   whether to continue, modify, or end the Beach Bug pilot;
    -   program evaluations, findings, observations, or assessments;
    -   rationale or factors considered in deciding not to extend or
        renew the pilot.

**2. Interdepartmental Coordination**

-   Communications between the Mayor's Office and Sustainability &
    Mobility regarding the timing, coordination, or approval of ending
    the pilot.
-   Communications reflecting discussions of who should make the public
    announcement, when it should occur, or how the conclusion was to be
    presented to the public or to the vendor.

**3. Leadership Review**

-   Records showing review, approval, or concurrence by directors,
    deputy directors, chiefs of staff, or senior advisors concerning the
    end of Beach Bug operations.

### **Preferred Format**

Please provide responsive records in their native digital format where
available, consistent with Gov. Code § 6253.9.

### **Processing & Timelines**

Please provide a determination within 10 calendar days as required by §
7922.535.\
If an extension is necessary, identify the statutory basis and provide
an estimated completion date.\
Please release responsive material on a **rolling basis** as it becomes
available.

### **Assistance to Clarify / Duty to Assist**

Under Gov. Code § 7922.600, agencies must assist requesters in
identifying records and describing the information sought.\
If clarification would expedite processing, please contact us **before
closing the request** so we may refine scope collaboratively.

### **Withholdings & Redactions**

For any withheld or redacted records, please provide:

-   The specific statutory exemption relied upon;
-   A description sufficient to identify each record's nature and
    approximate volume; and
-   An explanation of how the exemption applies, as required by §
    7922.535(a).\
    Please release all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions.

### **Search Scope**

Please identify all offices, staff, and systems reasonably likely to
hold responsive material.\
This includes, but is **not limited to**, departments or contractors
involved in parking management, transportation, sustainability &
mobility, procurement, budget oversight, or administration of the
Pacific Beach Community Parking District.\
If any such custodians or systems are *excluded* from the search, please
identify them and explain why.\
Nothing in this paragraph should be construed to limit the City's
obligation to conduct a thorough search for responsive records under
Gov. Code § 7922.600.

### **Purpose and Public Interest**

This request seeks to document the City's evaluation, internal
discussion, and approval process surrounding the conclusion of the
Pacific Beach "Beach Bug" shuttle program. It is intended to identify
who reviewed or authorized the termination, what analyses or
recommendations informed that decision, and how the conclusion was
communicated or implemented within the City.

Although this request focuses on the City's decision-making and
oversight phase, it forms part of a broader public effort to understand
the full life cycle of the Beach Bug program --- from funding through
termination --- to ensure transparency in the use of Community Parking
District revenues and promised local-mobility projects. Access to these
records is plainly in the public interest and consistent with Article I,
§ 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution, which requires open access to
local-government records and narrowly construes any claimed limitation.
