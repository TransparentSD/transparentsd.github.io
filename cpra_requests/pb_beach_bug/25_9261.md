# Request 25-9261

**Subject:** CPRA Request -- Beach Bug Shuttle: Talking Points & Public
Messaging

**To the Records Coordinator:**

Pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code §§ 7920.000 et
seq.) and Article I, § 3(b) of the California Constitution, the San
Diego Transparency Project requests the following public records
relating to the City's evaluation and termination of the Pacific Beach
"Beach Bug" community shuttle program.

This is a new and separate request focused solely on the specific record
categories listed below. This request is based on material recently
released through PRA 25-8845 (Council District 1), which referenced
coordinated talking points and announcement planning not previously
identified.

### **Date Range:** June 1 2022 -- present

### **Records Requested**

**1. Talking Points & Public Messaging**

-   Draft and final talking points prepared by or circulated within the
    Communications Department, Sustainability & Mobility Department,
    Mayor's Office, or Council District 1 related to the ending, winding
    down, or public announcement of the Beach Bug shuttle program.
-   Any internal or external communications transmitting these talking
    points to staff, consultants, or vendor representatives.

**2. Announcement Planning**

-   Draft press releases, public statements, rider notification scripts,
    public meeting announcement language, or City-prepared messaging
    concerning the conclusion of the Beach Bug service.
-   Records showing timing coordination for announcements (e.g.,
    references to Mobility Board notification, press timing, or rider
    email timing).

**3. Messaging Alignment With Vendor**

-   Communications with Ride Circuit or its representatives relating to
    messaging consistency, timing, sequencing, or alignment of public
    statements or rider notices concerning the end of service.

### **Preferred Format**

Please provide responsive records in their native digital format where
available, consistent with Gov. Code § 6253.9.

### **Processing & Timelines**

Please provide a determination within 10 calendar days as required by §
7922.535.\
If an extension is necessary, identify the statutory basis and provide
an estimated completion date.\
Please release responsive material on a **rolling basis** as it becomes
available.

### **Assistance to Clarify / Duty to Assist**

Under Gov. Code § 7922.600, agencies must assist requesters in
identifying records and describing the information sought.\
If clarification would expedite processing, please contact us **before
closing the request** so we may refine scope collaboratively.

### **Withholdings & Redactions**

For any withheld or redacted records, please provide:

-   The specific statutory exemption relied upon;
-   A description sufficient to identify each record's nature and
    approximate volume; and
-   An explanation of how the exemption applies, as required by §
    7922.535(a).\
    Please release all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions.

### **Search Scope**

Please identify all offices, staff, and systems reasonably likely to
hold responsive material.\
This includes, but is **not limited to**, departments or contractors
involved in parking management, transportation, sustainability &
mobility, procurement, budget oversight, or administration of the
Pacific Beach Community Parking District.\
If any such custodians or systems are *excluded* from the search, please
identify them and explain why.\
Nothing in this paragraph should be construed to limit the City's
obligation to conduct a thorough search for responsive records under
Gov. Code § 7922.600.

### **Purpose and Public Interest**

This request seeks to document the City's evaluation, internal
discussion, and approval process surrounding the conclusion of the
Pacific Beach "Beach Bug" shuttle program. It is intended to identify
who reviewed or authorized the termination, what analyses or
recommendations informed that decision, and how the conclusion was
communicated or implemented within the City.

Although this request focuses on the City's decision-making and
oversight phase, it forms part of a broader public effort to understand
the full life cycle of the Beach Bug program --- from funding through
termination --- to ensure transparency in the use of Community Parking
District revenues and promised local-mobility projects. Access to these
records is plainly in the public interest and consistent with Article I,
§ 3(b)(2) of the California Constitution, which requires open access to
local-government records and narrowly construes any claimed limitation.
